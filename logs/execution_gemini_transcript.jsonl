DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need.

Resource Constraints\n   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments\n   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming\n   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models\n   - Document what you couldn't complete\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRemember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: NLP\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication & Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration & Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=\"gpt-4\"):\n    \"\"\"Robust API calling with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2. Data Organization\n\n**Input Data**\n```\ndatasets/\n├── raw/\n│   ├── benchmark_v1.json          # Original benchmark\n│   ├── custom_test_set.jsonl      # Custom evaluation set\n│   └── prompts/\n│       ├── baseline_prompt.txt\n│       └── optimized_prompt_v3.txt\n├── processed/\n│   └── formatted_for_api.json     # API-ready format\n└── README.md                       # Dataset documentation\n```\n\n**Results Structure**\n```\nresults/\n├── model_outputs/\n│   ├── gpt4_responses.json        # Raw model outputs\n│   ├── claude_responses.json\n│   └── metadata.json              # Model versions, timestamps\n├── evaluations/\n│   ├── automated_scores.json      # Metric scores\n│   ├── human_annotations.csv      # Human eval results\n│   └── error_analysis.md          # Categorized failures\n└── visualizations/\n    ├── performance_comparison.png\n    └── error_breakdown.png\n```\n\n### 3.

Error Analysis\n\n**Categorization**\nCreate error taxonomy specific to your task:\n- Factual errors vs. reasoning errors\n- Format/parsing failures vs. content failures\n- Systematic patterns vs. random errors\n\n**Qualitative Analysis**\n- Sample and manually inspect errors across spectrum\n- Identify root causes (data quality, prompt ambiguity, model limitation)\n- Document representative examples\n\n### 2. Visualization\n\n**Recommended Plots**\n- Performance by difficulty level\n- Error rate by category\n- Model comparison (bar charts, radar plots)\n- Performance vs. cost/latency trade-offs\n- Learning curves (few-shot: 0, 1, 3, 5... examples)\n\n### 3. Results Presentation\n\n**Tables**\n- Clear headers with metric definitions\n- Bold best results, underline second-best\n- Include baselines (random, majority, simple heuristic)\n- Report confidence intervals or std dev\n\n**Discussion**\n- Interpret results in context of hypotheses\n- Discuss limitations and failure modes\n- Address threats to validity\n- Suggest future work based on findings\n\n## Domain-Specific Considerations\n\n### Prompt Engineering Research\n- Test on diverse tasks, not just one\n- Compare against baseline prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)\n- Measure generalization across models\n- Consider prompt length vs. performance trade-offs\n\n### AI Agent Evaluation\n- Define clear success metrics for agent tasks\n- Log intermediate states and decisions\n- Compare against human performance when feasible\n- Test tool usage accuracy and efficiency\n\n### Benchmark Creation\n- Pilot with baseline models first\n- Check for annotation quality and consistency\n- Test for unintended biases or shortcuts\n- Validate with diverse model families\n\n### LLM Capabilities Studies\n- Control for confounds (model size, training data, etc.)\n- Test across model families, not just one provider\n- Consider emergent abilities at different scales\n- Document API behavior changes over time\n\n## Resource Guidance\n\n**Compute Resources**\n- For API-based research: CPU is sufficient, no GPU needed\n- For model downloads: You MAY download models if needed for research\n  - Small models (<7B params): Can run on CPU\n  - Larger models (7B-70B): May need GPU, but check if API alternative exists\n- RAM: 8-16GB typical; more if loading large models\n- Storage: Download datasets and models as needed for research\n\n**Model Selection (2025)**\n\nIMPORTANT: Use state-of-the-art models for credible research results.\nCRITICAL: For LLM research, use REAL models (APIs or downloads) and run them with experiments, do not simulate fake models!\n\n**Recommended Models (as of 2025):**\n- **GPT-4.1 or GPT-5** (OpenAI, August 2025) - Best for everyday reasoning, coding, reliability\n  - API: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-codex` (for coding tasks)\n  - Pricing: ~$1.25/M input tokens, ~$10/M output tokens\n  - Context: Standard context window\n\n- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic, September 2025) - Best for coding, agents, polished writing\n  - API: `claude-sonnet-4-5`\n  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens\n  - Excels at: Complex B2B workflows, multi-file reasoning, autonomous agents\n\n- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google, June 2025) - Best for long context, visual reasoning\n  - API: `gemini-2-5-pro`\n  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens\n  - Features: Computer Use for browser control, excellent multimodal\n\nYou may also search models on openrouter. You can assume that we have the api keys available as environment variables\n**When to use older/smaller models:**\n- Historical baselines: Compare new methods against prior SOTA\n- Ablation studies: Test how model size affects phenomenon\n- Resource constraints: Explicitly justified (e.g., on-device deployment)\n\n**AVOID using models older than 2024** unless explicitly justified as baseline comparison.\nDo NOT use: FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, Claude 2.x, Gemini 1.0 as primary evaluation models.\n\n**When to Download Models vs. Use APIs**\n\nUse APIs when:\n- Testing LLM behavior, prompting strategies, calibration\n- Benchmarking multiple models\n- Multi-agent systems research\n- Budget and speed are important\n\nDownload models from HuggingFace when:\n- Mechanistic interpretability research (need model internals)\n- Fine-tuning or training required\n- Need offline access or repeated access\n- Probing, feature extraction, activation analysis\n\nFor downloads:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\n# Small models work on CPU\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"model-name\")\n```\n\nCommon model sizes:\n- <1B params: Tiny models, CPU-friendly\n- 1-7B params: Small models, can run on CPU slowly or GPU\n- 7-70B params: Large models, typically need GPU or use API instead\n\n**Cost and Resource Guidance** (not hard limits)\n\nAPI Costs (typical):\n- Small-scale (<1000 examples): $10-50\n- Medium-scale (<10000 examples): $50-200\n- Large-scale experiments: $200-500+\n- Use resources appropriate for your research question\n- Document costs in your final report\n\nTime (typical):\n- Quick experiments: 1-3 hours\n- Full research cycle: 3-8 hours\n- Complex multi-day projects are acceptable if needed\n- Quality matters more than speed\n\nIMPORTANT: These are GUIDELINES, not hard limits.\n- If good research requires more resources, use them\n- Don't compromise research quality to save costs\n- Do track and document what you use\n\n## Example Research Workflows\n\n### Workflow 1: Prompt Optimization Study\n1.

Research Question\n**Is humor recognition in Large Language Models (LLMs) represented by a low-rank subspace in the activation space?**\n\nSpecifically, we ask:\n1.  Can a simple linear probe (1D subspace) distinguish between humorous and non-humorous text with high accuracy?\n2.  What is the effective dimensionality of the \"humor subspace\"?\n3.  Does this representation emerge in specific layers of the model?\n\n## 2. Background and Motivation\nRecent work (Tigges et al., Marx et al.) suggests that high-level concepts like \"sentiment\" and \"truth\" are represented linearly (1D) in LLMs. Humor is a more complex, subjective, and often context-dependent attribute. Determining if humor is also \"low rank\" would:\n-   Validate the universality of the \"linear representation\" hypothesis.\n-   Enable efficient \"humor steering\" (making models funnier or more serious via vector addition).\n-   Provide insights into how LLMs semanticize abstract concepts.\n\n## 3. Hypothesis Decomposition\n-   **H1 (Separability)**: The activation space of LLMs contains a hyperplane that separates jokes from non-jokes with high accuracy (>85%).\n-   **H2 (Low Rank)**: The variance of the difference vectors (Joke - NonJoke) is concentrated in a very small number of dimensions (Top 3 PCs explain >50% variance).\n-   **H3 (Layer-specificity)**: This separability is not present in early layers (lexical processing) but emerges in middle/late layers (semantic processing).\n\n## 4. Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nWe will use a **mechanistic interpretability** approach involving:\n1.  **Activation Extraction**: Running a pre-trained LLM (`gpt2-large`) on a balanced dataset of Jokes and Non-Jokes.\n2.  **Probing**: Training linear classifiers on these activations.\n3.  **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA to analyze the intrinsic rank of the humor representation.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Data Preparation**:\n    -   Load `datasets/short_jokes/shortjokes.csv` (Source: Kaggle Short Jokes).\n    -   Load `datasets/wikitext_hf` (Source: WikiText-2, representing \"neutral/factual\" text).\n    -   Sample N=2000 items from each, filtering for length (e.g., 10-50 tokens) to ensure comparability.\n2.  **Model Loading**:\n    -   Use `gpt2-large` (774M params). It is large enough to \"get\" jokes but small enough for efficient local inference and activation storage.\n3.  **Activation Extraction**:\n    -   Pass inputs through the model.\n    -   Extract residual stream activations from the **last token** at each layer.\n    -   Store as `(N_samples, N_layers, D_model)`.\n4.  **Analysis 1: Linear Separability**:\n    -   For each layer, train a Logistic Regression classifier (with 5-fold CV).\n    -   Metric: Accuracy and F1-score.\n5.  **Analysis 2: Intrinsic Dimensionality**:\n    -   Compute the \"Humor Direction\" via Difference-in-Means ($\\mu_{joke} - \\mu_{normal}$).\n    -   Perform PCA on the union of both classes (or just the difference vectors).\n    -   Calculate the **Explained Variance Ratio** of the top components.\n\n### Baselines\n-   **Random Embeddings**: Probing on a randomly initialized model (control for architecture).\n-   **Lexical Baseline**: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (control for simple word usage like \"laugh\", \"funny\").\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n-   **Classification Accuracy**: For the linear probe.\n-   **Explained Variance Ratio**: For PCA (e.g., \"PC1 explains 40% of variance\").\n-   **Cosine Similarity**: Between the \"Humor Vector\" found via means and the probe's weight vector.\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n-   Use 5-fold Cross-Validation for probing to ensure robustness.\n-   Report Mean ± Std Dev for accuracy.\n-   Compare peak accuracy against baselines using a t-test.\n\n## 5. Timeline and Milestones (Single Session)\n\n-   **Phase 2: Setup (10 min)**\n    -   Install `torch`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `tqdm`.\n    -   Verify data loading scripts.\n-   **Phase 3: Implementation (45 min)**\n    -   `data_loader.py`: Prepare balanced dataset.\n    -   `extract_activations.py`: Pipeline for getting hidden states.\n    -   `analysis.py`: Probing and PCA logic.\n-   **Phase 4: Experimentation (45 min)**\n    -   Run extraction on `gpt2-large`.\n    -   Run analysis sweep across all layers.\n-   **Phase 5: Analysis (30 min)**\n    -   Generate \"Accuracy vs Layer\" plot.\n    -   Generate \"Explained Variance\" scree plot.\n    -   Interpret results.\n-   **Phase 6: Reporting (20 min)**\n    -   Write `REPORT.md`.\n\n## 6. Potential Challenges\n-   **Memory Limits**: Storing activations for 4000 samples x 36 layers x 1280 dims is large (~700MB). *Mitigation*: Process layer-by-layer or save to disk using `numpy.memmap`.\n-   **Confounders**: Jokes might just be shorter or have different punctuation (e.g., \"?\"). *Mitigation*: Filter by length match.\n-   **Polysemy**: \"Humor\" is broad. The probe might just pick up on \"informal style\". *Acceptance*: We acknowledge this limitation; distinguishing \"informal\" from \"funny\" requires a harder negative dataset (e.g., failed jokes), which we don't have. We test \"Humorous vs Neutral\".\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n-   We successfully extract activations.\n-   We find a layer where Linear Probe Accuracy > 85% (beating TF-IDF).\n-   We determine if the representation is low-rank (Top 3 PCs explain > 50%).\n"}}

Executive Summary\nThis study investigated the internal representation of humor in the GPT-2 Large language model. We hypothesized that humor recognition is a \"low-rank\" task, meaning it can be represented by a low-dimensional subspace (or even a single direction) within the model's activation space. Our experiments comparing 2,000 short jokes against 2,000 neutral WikiText samples confirm this hypothesis with striking strength: **humor (specifically, joke vs. non-joke text) is linearly separable with 100% accuracy even in the first layer**, and a single principal component (Rank 1) is sufficient to capture this distinction. This suggests that \"Joke Mode\" vs \"Factual Mode\" is a fundamental, highly distinct feature in the model's latent geometry.\n\n## 2. Goal\nThe primary research question was: **How low rank is humor recognition in LLMs?**\nUnderstanding the geometry of concepts like humor allows for:\n-   Better steerability (e.g., adding a \"humor vector\" to generation).\n-   Insight into how LLMs organize semantic information.\n-   Verification of the \"Linear Representation Hypothesis\" for subjective concepts.\n\n## 3. Data Construction\n\n### Datasets\n-   **Positive Class (Jokes)**: 2,000 samples from the *Short Jokes Dataset* (Kaggle).\n-   **Negative Class (Non-Jokes)**: 2,000 samples from *WikiText-2* (HuggingFace).\n\n### Preprocessing\n-   **Filtering**: Both datasets were filtered to include only texts between 15 and 60 tokens. This controls for length as a confounding variable.\n-   **Balancing**: The final dataset was perfectly balanced (50/50 split).\n\n### Example Samples\n**Joke**:\n> \"I can't believe I got fired from the calendar factory. All I did was take a day off.\"\n\n**Non-Joke (WikiText)**:\n> \"The game was released in Japan on December 12 , 1999 , and in North America on February 29 , 2000 .\"\n\n## 4. Methodology\n\n### Model\n-   **Architecture**: `gpt2-large` (774M parameters).\n-   **Access**: We extracted residual stream activations from the **last token** of the input sequence.\n\n### Experimental Protocol\n1.  **Activation Extraction**: We ran the 4,000 samples through the model and saved activations for all 36 layers.\n2.  **Linear Probing**: We trained a Logistic Regression classifier on each layer's activations (5-fold CV) to measure linear separability.\n3.  **Dimensionality Analysis**:\n    -   **1D Difference Mean**: We computed the vector $\\vec{d} = \\vec{\\mu}_{joke} - \\vec{\\mu}_{non}$, projected data onto it, and measured classification accuracy.\n    -   **PCA Rank Analysis**: We performed PCA on the training data and measured probing accuracy using only the top $k$ components.\n\n## 5. Result Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1.  **Perfect Linear Separability**:\n    -   The linear probe achieved **100.0% accuracy** across ALL layers (0 to 36).\n    -   This indicates that the distinction between \"Joke\" and \"WikiText\" is fully encoded even in the initial embeddings or first attention block.\n\n2.  **It is Rank 1**:\n    -   The \"Difference-in-Means\" classifier (which projects data onto a single line) also achieved **~100% accuracy**.\n    -   PCA analysis showed that using just the **Top 1 Principal Component** yields >99% accuracy.\n\n### Visualizations\n\n#### Accuracy vs Layer\n*(See `results/plots/accuracy_vs_layer.png`)*\nThe curve is flat at 1.0. This is unusual for complex semantic tasks (which usually improve in later layers) and suggests that the model distinguishes these domains immediately, likely based on lexical or stylistic cues (e.g., \"I\", \"my\", question marks vs. dates, formal nouns).\n\n#### Accuracy vs Rank\n*(See `results/plots/accuracy_vs_rank.png`)*\n-   Rank 1: 99.1% (Layer 0) -> 100% (Layer 6+)\n-   Rank 2: 100%\nThe subspace for this task is effectively 1-dimensional.\n\n### Interpretation & Limitations\nThe hypothesis \"Humor is low rank\" is supported, but with a caveat:\n-   **Style vs. Concept**: The task likely measured \"Conversational/Joke Style\" vs \"Encyclopedic Style\". The model didn't necessarily \"get\" the joke, but it instantly recognized the *format* of a joke.\n-   **Easy Negatives**: WikiText is a very easy negative class. A more rigorous test would be \"Jokes vs Serious conversational text\" or \"Jokes vs Failed Jokes\".\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nHumor recognition (defined as distinguishing jokes from encyclopedic text) is an **extremely low-rank (Rank 1)** phenomenon in GPT-2 Large. The representation is robust, global, and present from the very first layer. This implies that \"genre\" or \"mode\" is one of the most dominant features in the model's activation space, far overpowering subtler semantic nuances.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1.  **Harder Negatives**: Repeat the experiment using \"Common Crawl\" or \"Reddit\" comments as the negative class to control for conversational style.\n2.  **Steering**: Attempt to add the computed \"Humor Vector\" to the activations during generation to see if it makes the model output funnier or just more informal.\n3.  **Fine-grained Analysis**: can we distinguish *types* of humor (Puns vs Sarcasm)?\n","file_path":"REPORT.md"}}
